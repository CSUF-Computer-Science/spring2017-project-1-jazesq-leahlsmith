Our Project 1 program contains changes made to the Baby.h and MedicalRecord.h files. By running this program a medical record is built containing the first names and weights in grams of babies born. The functionality of the program allows you to upload a file and create a record, find the number of babies born, find the number of births of  children with the same name, find how many were born with a low weight of under 2500 grams, and find the most popluar baby name in the record.
